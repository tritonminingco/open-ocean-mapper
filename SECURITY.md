## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities privately to avoid public disclosure before a fix is available:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

## Sensitive Data Handling

### Bathymetric Data Privacy

Ocean mapping data may contain sensitive information:

- **Vessel Identification**: Use anonymization features
- **Location Data**: Apply GPS jittering for sensitive areas
- **Survey Metadata**: Remove identifying information before sharing

### Anonymization Guidelines

```bash
# Always anonymize sensitive data
python cli/open-ocean-mapper.py convert \
  --input survey_data.csv \
  --anonymize \
  --output ./anonymized/
```

### Configuration Security

- **Never commit** API keys or credentials to the repository
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Rotate credentials** regularly
- **Use least privilege** access principles

### Example Secure Configuration

```yaml
# config_template.yml
seabed2030:
  api_key: ${SEABED2030_API_KEY}  # From environment
  endpoint: ${SEABED2030_ENDPOINT}
  
anonymization:
  vessel_id_salt: ${ANONYMIZATION_SALT}
  gps_jitter_radius: 50  # meters
```

## Data Protection

### Input Validation

- Validate all file formats before processing
- Sanitize metadata fields
- Check file size limits
- Verify coordinate system validity

### Output Security

- Sign exported files with checksums
- Include provenance metadata
- Validate NetCDF/BAG file integrity
- Log all conversion operations

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate authentication tokens
- Log security events

## Security Best Practices

### Development

- Use dependency scanning tools
- Regular security audits
- Code review for security issues
- Automated vulnerability scanning

### Deployment

- Use container security scanning
- Implement network segmentation
- Regular security updates
- Monitor for anomalies

### Data Storage

- Encrypt data at rest
- Use secure file permissions
- Implement access logging
- Regular backup verification

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

- **File Upload**: No virus scanning implemented
- **Authentication**: Basic token-based auth only
- **Encryption**: No end-to-end encryption for uploads
- **Audit Logging**: Limited security event logging

### Planned Improvements

- Implement WebAuthn authentication
- Add file content validation
- Enhance audit logging
- Implement role-based access control

## Security Tools Integration

### CI/CD Security

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning
- Secret detection
- Code quality gates

### Runtime Security

- Application performance monitoring
- Security event correlation
- Automated threat detection
- Incident response procedures

## Compliance

### Data Regulations

- **GDPR**: Handle personal data according to EU regulations
- **CCPA**: Comply with California privacy requirements
- **Marine Data**: Follow oceanographic data sharing standards

### Industry Standards

- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security controls
- **OWASP**: Web application security guidelines
